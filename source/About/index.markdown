I am Cory Gackenheimer, this is my site. I [tweet](http://twitter.com/cgack) things and [+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/106019314707355006807/) things as well.  

I am a Software Engineer currently residing in Indiana.  I work for [Healthx](http://healthx.com) during the day, and hack on JavaScript and other sorts of nerdy code things. 
I have written the book Node.js Recipes and contribute to open source projects
I'm a Mozillian and would encourage everyone to be a part of the best documentation out there on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org). I write here occasionally, so check back whenever.
