										<h2>Canvas Drawing Demo</h2>

										<p>This Demo is a simple canvas drawing demo origianlly created for a Preschooler.  I used the History API to allow for undo [browser back OR ctrl + z] and redo [browser fwd OR ctrl + y].  It won the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/demos/devderby/2011/august">August Dev Derby</a>.  Check it out <a href="http://cgack.com/drawings/">here</a></p>

										<h2>Orientation Demos</h2>

										<p>Another Dev Derby Entry I submitted was for device orientation.  I utilized the device orientation event to control a ball on an html canvas element that is used to catch a target ball.  The goal is to do it quickly.  If you device doesn&#8217;t support orientation events you can click/tap to change the location of the ball, and you may also control the location using the keyboard H, J, K, L keys.  The Dev Derby entry is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/demos/devderby/2012/january">here</a> and my github hosted version is <a href="http://cgack.com/catch">here</a>.</p>

										<p>In the above demo I did not utilize the DeviceOrientationEvent.alpha parameter which is basically the cardinal direction of your device (think compass).  So I created a simple compass out of the orienation api which can be found <a href="http://cgack.com/cardinal">here</a>.</p>
