Months ago I set out to create a nodejs based app for one of our office favorite games - Wizard (the ultimate game of trump). I started the project by myself, but after I got it to the point where I thought it could really become something I enlisted the help of a friend to help contribute to really speed up the development. Things went well and we reached the point&nbsp; somewhere around SXSW 2012 where it became playable and testable, though admittedly it is still in a fairly unstable state. We had privately hosted it on Bitbucket and collaborated through there, but I decided today that we are going to unleash it as a <a href="https://github.com/cgack/wizard">public repo on Github</a>.&nbsp; So there it is. You can create your own instance of it and test and contribute (pull requests, issues, etc) as much as you like.&nbsp; If you just want to see it in action, you can view the latest stable build that I have hosted with nodejitsu currently at http://wiz.jit.su.
