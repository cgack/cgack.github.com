I want to maximize my time in the cloud, but as a Software Engineer, I currently spend a majority of my day developing web applications tethered to a desktop development environment loaded onto a workstation running a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS/">popular operating system</a> developed in Redmond, WA. &nbsp; This is a fine environment when I am capable of getting to my cubicle at the office, but when a massive ice storm (as an example) prevents my journey to the office park, I must be able to work remotely. &nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>There are many solutions to this problem, and most require some form of secure connection to my work network followed by a remote desktop session to control my machine at the office. &nbsp;Traditionally (before my chrome notebook) I had no reservations doing this as an adequate means to get my work done. &nbsp;On my Cr-48 my traditional methods of remotely connecting to my workstation are not possible, so I set out to find my new solution, a web-based remote desktop solution.<br /><br />There are plenty of these remote desktop solutions to choose from. &nbsp;A popularized method in recent commercials stating "to the cloud" is not applicable here since it would require a cloud connection via "Internet Explorer 6 or later (32-bit version only)", which is probably not how I'll be connecting using my Google Chrome OS notebook. &nbsp;A couple of other web applications that will allow remote access that I have tested since getting my Cr-48 are <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/">LogMeIn</a> and <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx">TeamViewer</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>After trying out both of these I think I'll settle on TeamViewer if I need to connect remotely. &nbsp;This application is extremely user friendly and quick to set up. &nbsp;Download the installer onto your remote PC, get the connection information, log into the web access site and you are looking at your remote PC. &nbsp;Just as with other remote connections it seems to lag a bit but I was connected and able to navigate my applications remotely without much trouble. &nbsp;I did experience one minor issue where the character mappings from keyboard input were a bit off, i.e. &nbsp;'/' key became 'ยง' but still nothing to prevent me from utilizing TeamViewer in a pinch. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>After going through all of this I feel that my real goal should be to get all of my work including the code base to the cloud so no matter where I am, what computer I'm sitting behind, I can get to work. &nbsp;Thats what I plan to do next with some amazing new tools like <a href="http://kodingen.com/">Kodingen</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coderun.com/">CodeRun</a>, and once I get my hands on the beta,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cloud9ide.com/">Cloud9</a></div></div>
