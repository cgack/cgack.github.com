Three days ago I received a marvelous gift from Google in the form of my very own CR-48 notebook. &nbsp;In December I had submitted my application to the <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeos/">Chrome OS pilot</a> program, crossed my fingers, and a half dozen weeks later was lucky enough to receive my very own chrome notebook, and it is amazing. <br /><div><br /></div><div>This stealth notebook comes complete with a fledgling operating system (chrome os) that is proving to be powerful enough for all my everyday computing needs. &nbsp;The boot time is remarkable, with the removal of standard operating system boot bloat, Chrome OS is running in ~10 seconds. &nbsp;There are plenty of sites discussing the specifications of this device in detail, and I am not going to review the device here. &nbsp; Other reviews state this device and the Chrome OS are dead in the water, but so far I have to disagree. &nbsp;I can see a bright future for a fast, affordable, notebook with a lightweight operating system designed so that no matter what my location, I am able to connect to the cloud quickly and accomplish all the tasks I need to. I am going to push this device to it limit and see what, if any, limitations it has.</div><div><br />I have been courting the cloud for some time, working in Google Docs, syncing photos to the web with Picasa, and loading a <a href="http://bkhome.org/wary/">lightweight linux distro</a> on an old HP laptop for nothing but netbook purposes, but now with the chrome notebook and Chrome OS I am going for a more committed relationship, attempting to detach myself completely (or as much as possible) from the standard operating system and live in the cloud.</div></div>
