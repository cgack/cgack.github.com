<div class='post'>
I have been doing a lot of development on my Cr-48 lately. &nbsp;And as I sit here coding away I wanted to note how useful chrome is to me as a developer. &nbsp;As I have written about previously there is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QI8nj6PSPI">plethora</a>&nbsp;of web-based IDEs to develop with in Chrome OS. &nbsp;So what I have been finding particularly useful regardless of the development environment is something any chrome user (I'm talking browser now, not OS) can utilize...the <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html">Chrome Developer Tools</a>. &nbsp;Before I received my Cr-48, the majority of my browser based debug sessions lived in Firefox with the amazing and powerful tool <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, but thanks to Google I was forced to try something new. &nbsp;I thought nothing else compared to Firebug (I am not going to speak out against Firefox or Firebug as both are spectacular), but as I have familiarized myself with the Chrome tools I find they are just as powerful and robust. &nbsp;I love how easy it is to inspect an element on the page and edit CSS and JavaScript, check network events, record a timeline, or just drill through local variables in the console. &nbsp;So if you are like I was, before you move from chrome to some other tool just to step through your JavaScript in the console, stop and give the Chrome Developer Tools a try, you might decide to stay.</div>
