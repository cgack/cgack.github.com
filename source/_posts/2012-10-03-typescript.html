This week Microsoft released its shiny new JavaScript pre-processor - <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. It represents a superset of JavaScript that is designed for large-scale application development. It utilizes concepts that most developers are comfortable with in their non JavaScript languages. Things like Classes, Modules, and Type checking.<br /><br />These are all things that many people complain that JavaScript does not have built in.&nbsp; With TypeScript, JavaScript does not magically gain these things. TypeScript makes these things accessible to a developer through its pre processing. Developers and JavaScript do not need TypeScript, and it is not a requirement to build large scale applications. It won't magically make crappy programming better, but it may help catch a gotcha for someone every now and again, just as <a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a> would. I for one think that it will take off rather well, especially in the ASP.Net community. I also will probably try it out in a project or two or three. I like that it looks and feels like JavaScript, which is a syntax that I am comfortable with.&nbsp; That is one reason why I have not adopted <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, it just looks so foreign to me. I suppose if I were a full time Ruby on Rails developer, CoffeeScript would feel right, but I'm not, so it doesn't.<br /><br />I'm going to end this by just showing the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript. It is subtle and that is appealing to me. See the comparisons below:<br /><br />
<pre>
<code>
// TypeScript
class Greeter {
	greeting: string;
	constructor (message: string) {
		this.greeting = message;
	}
	greet() {
		return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
	}
}   
 
var greeter = new Greeter("world");
 
var button = document.createElement('button')
button.innerText = "Say Hello"
button.onclick = function() {
	alert(greeter.greet())
}
 
document.body.appendChild(button);

// JavaScript
var Greeter = (function () {
    function Greeter(message) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    Greeter.prototype.greet = function () {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    };
    return Greeter;
})();
var greeter = new Greeter("world");
var button = document.createElement('button');
button.innerText = "Say Hello";
button.onclick = function () {
    alert(greeter.greet());
};
document.body.appendChild(button);
</code>
