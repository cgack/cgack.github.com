<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">I have come to the conclusion that there is plenty of selection for online application development using a web-based development environment.  After trying out several online IDE's over the last few months I was asked by a reader to check out <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a>.  I had read that this was an editor of choice for many on some of the Chrome OS forums where the question of what is used to develop on the Cr-48 usually shows up.  So I decided I would try out another IDE to get a feel for how it compares to others I have tried.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">First off, bonus points for allowing Google (or Facebook) login.  After authentication, this feels like a desktop IDE similar to what I feel like in <a href="http://www.coderun.com/ide/">CodeRun</a>, <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>, or <a href="http://www.akshell.com/ide/">Akshell</a> (I usually test this by going full screen on my Cr-48 and say its good if it isn't obvious I am in a web browser).  Selection of file formats is diverse and allows for PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, or Text with built-in FTP support, which is nice for those who enjoy diverse development.  I tried to create a trivial web page and was pleased with the HTML editor with the exception of when I tried the split view (HTML and Design viewed at the same time) I found it hard to keep the focus on the HTML screen and ended up navigating away from the editor when hitting backspace to delete a <div>.  This is not a huge deal as I would likely not develop full time in split view.  </span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">JavaScript editing is almost too full featured for my taste by default.  There is an auto complete feature that will auto close brackets in your code as you type.  I found that I was creating double closing brackets so I turned that feature off which was easy enough in the Edit -&gt; Preferences menu.  However,  JSLint is a wonderful addition to any JavaScript Editor, and is fully configurable in the Preferences section (so if you don't like to be forced to use === instead of == you can allow that).</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">A feature that I've recently learned is important to me in an online IDE is allowing for multiple tabs to be opened at once.  ShiftEdit does this well.
