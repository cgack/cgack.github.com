I used to think that building web applications in Python for Google's app engine was reserved for a desktop development environment. &nbsp;I had hacked a bit on an app or two and used the command line tools to test and publish to the app engine. &nbsp;Then I discovered <a href="https://coderbuddy1.appspot.com/">CoderBuddy</a>. &nbsp; CoderBuddy is a one stop shop for building python apps for the app engine. &nbsp;Once signed in you can create a blank project, or get a head start with one of six template apps. &nbsp;One template is of course a "hello world" app, but there are a &nbsp;few other samples including 3 that come with some <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (arguably the go to MVC framework for python web applications). &nbsp; I tested a couple of the template apps and found them to be quite useful. &nbsp;The "Adrian Remembers Me" template creates an app that allows users to become members and sign in. &nbsp; Here is a look at the editor with the main.py file opened for this project:<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ES_BL0gUWTM/TqLjtn668qI/AAAAAAAAApU/-SwPW-jQsw8/s1600/cgack2-coderbuddy+-+CoderBuddy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="256" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ES_BL0gUWTM/TqLjtn668qI/AAAAAAAAApU/-SwPW-jQsw8/s400/cgack2-coderbuddy+-+CoderBuddy.png" width="400" /></a><br />

Each of these templates could be either a good launching point or reference for a new developer looking to quickly create a Python app. &nbsp;Deploying to the App Engine is just a few clicks away with CoderBuddy. &nbsp;So I "created" my Adrian Remembers Me app in one click and about two minutes later had my site running on the app engine at&nbsp;<a href="http://cgack2-coderbuddy.appspot.com/">http://cgack2-coderbuddy.appspot.com/</a>. &nbsp;The ease of deploy along with the ability to upload files and download the project as a .zip I will definitely look to CoderBuddy for part if not all of my next project.
