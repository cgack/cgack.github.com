After a few days this week without Chrome OS due to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome-notebook-pilot/biRRijQapdc/FDs_l-29szQJ">a fun error</a> in the Dev build (though its never bad to be able to revert to Ubuntu), I am able to be a Cr-48 nerd again. &nbsp;The other day one of the three readers of this blog tipped me off on <a href="http://www.akshell.com/">Akshell</a>, another online development environment,&nbsp;which I quickly dove into in order to compare it against some of my other favorites which I have checked out previously <a href="http://go-cloud-go.blogspot.com/2011/02/coding-in-cloud.html">here</a>, <a href="http://go-cloud-go.blogspot.com/2011/02/coding-in-cloud-part-ii.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://go-cloud-go.blogspot.com/2011/03/coding-in-cloud-part.html">here</a>. &nbsp;By far my favorite has been <a href="http://kodingen.com/">Kodingen</a>, I still go to it to code around and generally geek it up. &nbsp;This all may change.<br /><br />Akshell is a brilliant development environment that utilizes JavaScript for not only the client-side programming, but also the Server-side. &nbsp;There are many cool features to how apps are developed and integrated in Akshell, which can be found in <a href="http://www.akshell.com/docs/0.3/">their documentation here</a>. &nbsp;I have found the environment to be amazing to use utilizing the default "ak" library and their Model-View-Controller framework. &nbsp;For my first test I tried to remake (and improve) the test site I created on Kodingen with Akshell. &nbsp;I found it was super fast to build with the Akshell environment and enabled me to test and preview just as smoothly as Kodingen though I think the interface with Akshell is much easier to navigate (perhaps because most of the features in Kodingen are still disabled in its current Beta state). &nbsp;I must admit that I did utilize <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> to quickly enhance my HTML5 canvas that I had created in Kodingen and then simply copied the JavaScript to Akshell. &nbsp;So what does a quick Akshell site look like? &nbsp;<a href="http://gocloudgo.akshell.com/">See mine here.</a><br /><br />One of the promising things about Akshell that I'll be getting into soon, is their relational database (PostgreSQL) that is&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;with their "Simple JavaScript API". &nbsp;From the documentation and the quick test I did with their relation variables I have to agree it is simple to use. &nbsp;I hope to get some time to get an app going that utilizes this database functionality soon. <br /><br />I don't know if I like Akshell an better than Kodingen as far as functionality and features (they both let you code, use a database, and deploy directly within their apps) but I can say that Akshell seems to be a more elegant solution to the online coding environment so I will definitely be using it for my next online coding&nbsp;endeavor.</div>

Thank you for the great write up. Just FYI, we are working on two way jsFiddle integration.</div>
