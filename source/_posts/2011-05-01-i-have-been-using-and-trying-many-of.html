I have been using and trying many of the all-in-one solutions for web-based development on my Cr-48, but what happens when your favorite editor does not deploy directly to where you want your app to live (<a href="http://c9.io/">cloud9</a>)? &nbsp;I tried this recently with a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> app and a cloud platform (currently in beta) called <a href="https://www.duostack.com/">Duostack</a>. &nbsp;For my NodeJS app, just as everyone else toying with Node, I <strike>reinvented</strike>&nbsp;reworked the wheel and used Ryan Dahl's (creator of NodeJS) basic chat application. &nbsp;All I did was partition the client to act like it had multiple rooms rather than one group room as in <a href="http://chat.nodejs.org/">the original</a>. &nbsp;That is not what this post is about. This post is about how easy it is to get a node instance up and running on Duostack.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Duostack is a super easy to use cloud platform as a service for Node and Ruby apps. &nbsp;Databases that are available by default are MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis (the documentation states external DBs are welcome). &nbsp;The deployments live on the Amazon EC2 by default, but there is 'cross-cloud reliability' that will allow for&nbsp;fail over&nbsp;to the Proactive Cloud in case of a <i>possible</i>&nbsp;Amazon outage. &nbsp;Deployment is as simple as it could get with a cloud platform (well it could get simpler, but its super easy as you can read below).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>To setup Duostack I had to move away from Chrome OS and into Ubuntu on my Cr-48. &nbsp;I followed the <a href="http://docs.duostack.com/node/command-line-client#setup">simple steps</a> to get the command line interface installed. &nbsp;I used the curl method versus the node package manager install and had my Duostack instance configured shortly thereafter. &nbsp;So now to create a Duostack app. &nbsp;This is even easier then setup of the command line client, simply type 'duostack create &lt;yourappnamehere&gt;' and you have it. Duostack uses Git to control deployment so deploying is also a snap, just feed the command 'git push duostack master' from your git repository, wait a few seconds while Duostack works the deployment magic, and you have your Duostack application deployed. &nbsp;Mine lives <a href="http://noderooms.duostack.net/">here</a>. &nbsp;So far I am more than pleased with my Duostack beta access and invite anyone with interest in deploying a Node or Ruby app to a cloud platform to <a href="https://www.duostack.com/signups/new">signup</a>&nbsp;and give it a try. &nbsp;I have a few other betas for platform as a service solutions to check out, but Duostack got first dibs by granting me beta access before the others.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
