This winter I was fortunate enough to be able to speak at two jQuery events - First in jQuery Conference in San Diego, then in Vienna for jQuery Europe. &nbsp;The traveling is always great, and these events were top notch as far as organization, content, and attendees. I have finally added links to the slides and the video here on my blog.

While I always enjoy attending conferences, these two seemed to be extra engaging in that the attendees I talked with all brought a great deal of encouragement and excitement to continue to share what they know and learn.

I was also able to spend more time with a few of the folks I have met from the jQuery team and really see the vision of where some of the projects are headed. From this, I have even started to spend some time trying to triage and/or fix issues on the jQuery Mobile project.

In any case, here are the <a href="http://presentboldly.com/cgack/unified-widget-theory-jquery-europe">slides</a> and video for my presentations about building $.Widgets for both UI and Mobile.
