Coding in the cloud is something I feel I need to be able to do easily now that I'm utilizing my Google Chrome OS notebook. &nbsp;<a href="http://go-cloud-go.blogspot.com/2011/02/coding-in-cloud.html">Last post</a> I discussed utilizing an online development environment called CodeRun and found it to be quite useful, but it is not my favorite cloud development environment. &nbsp;My favorite (so far) is called <a href="http://kodingen.com/">Kodingen</a>.<br /><br />Kodingen is "The Cloud Development Environment, Online Code Editor, Cloud Hosting, Web-based access to file system, Web-based ftp &amp; svn integration" or at least it will be all of those things. &nbsp;Currently Kodingen is in Beta v3 so not all of those features are available as of this writing. &nbsp;Even though this cloud development environment is not fully operational it is still fantastic. &nbsp;As shown on their site, there is code support for php, perl, and python [with future support of django, ruby on rails, fastcgi,...]. &nbsp;The site you create is hosted on Kodingen, and they offer a default 500mb of diskspace, 1000mb of monthly traffic, 1 domain, 6 subdomains, and 5 databases by default (of course you can "get extra resources"). &nbsp;So I set out to play around with Kodingen.<br /><br />Setting up an account was easy enough, so I logged in an got to work. &nbsp;I quickly <a href="http://gocloudgo.kodingen.com/">created a website</a> with an HTML5 canvas star field plastered on it all from the comfort of my Cr-48. &nbsp;As far as code editor selection, currently there is support for Bespin, CodeMirror, and Ymacs. &nbsp;I found that CodeMirror suits my needs best, though I might have been inclined to choose Bespin (probably because of its <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bespin">name</a>), but it lacks good support for copy/paste in Google Chrome.<br /><br />A couple features I have not utilized more than a simple evaluation are the database support and the image editing. &nbsp;Creating a MySQL database was a snap (PostgreSQL, and SqLite support to come) so I created a simple database with a couple tables that seemed to perform well enough. &nbsp;Image editing is currently supported using Pixlr (support for Aviary to come) and again seemed to perform well enough. &nbsp;Kodingen also reports future support for code repositories such as svn, git, and mercurial where one can create teams to manage joint coding efforts (can't wait to try it out).<br /><br />So after my week of trialling CodeRun and Kodingen, I must lean toward Kodingen based mostly on personal preference, but I feel that both systems create a sound cloud based development environment. &nbsp;As I mentioned in the last post I think these systems would be ideal for educators wishing to introduce their students to web development or as a great code on the go environment.</div>
