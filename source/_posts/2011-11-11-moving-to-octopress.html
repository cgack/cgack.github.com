I started blogging here a while back, mostly about the cloud and what I could do with my cool new chromebook the cr-48. &nbsp;I've hacked around a bit in the cloud using Chrome OS, but I find myself enjoying Ubuntu on my cr-48 more than Chrome OS. &nbsp;In my playing around with different sites, IDEs, tools, and engines I came across <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>&nbsp;and thought it would be fun to try it out. &nbsp;So I did and I liked it. &nbsp;From there I decided to move my blog over there for future posts. &nbsp;I went through the work to convert these blogger posts from here -&gt; go-cloud-go.blogspot.com (now blog.cgack.com) &nbsp;to their new home at cgack.com/blog but they likely aren't all picture perfect so if there are broken links or anything I apologize. &nbsp;So there you have it. this blog is moving to its new home at <a href="http://cgack.com/blog">cgack.com/blog</a></div>
