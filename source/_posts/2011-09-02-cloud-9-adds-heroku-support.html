One of my favorite online IDEs has added support for Heroku.  This is great news as I have enjoyed developing node.js applications in <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9</a> but felt that the main thing it lacked was a method to deploy directly to the cloud.  So I took it for a test run.  I signed in to Cloud 9 and created a simple hello world app, make sure you use the process.env.PORT to listen on so Heroku can deploy it properly.<br /><br />Commit your changes via the Cloud 9 git interface.Then all you have to do is click the Deploy button in Cloud 9, sign in to Heroku, create your new instance, and deploy.  If you haven't created a package.json or Procfile (needed for Heroku deploy), Cloud 9 will create those for you.  My hello world is at <a href="http://cheese.herokuapp.com/">http://cheese.herokuapp.com/</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-6512242240963047422?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
