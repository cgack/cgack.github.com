Since Firefox moved to a rapid release cycle, there has been concern by some (including myself) as to whether add-ons would stay compatible with each of the new versions, and how one would go about testing to find any breaking changes.&nbsp; In news that makes a geek happy - Mozilla has taken care of that for me as I received notice from Mozilla that stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Dear add-on author,<br /><br />Good news! Our automated tests did not detect any compatibility issues  with your add-on Google Music Hotkeys and Firefox 9.*. We've updated  your add-on's compatibility to work with Firefox 9.* so that our Aurora  users can begin using it.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">This compatibility bump is server-side and we did not modify your add-on  package in any way. If you wish or need to revert this change, just go  to your add-on edit page on <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">addons.mozilla.org</a>, select the Status &amp; Versions page, then the version, and change its maxVersion compatibility back to its previous value.<br /><br />For more information on our new compatibility process with rapid Firefox releases, please read this post: <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2011/04/19/add-on-compatibility-rapid-releases/" target="_blank">http://blog.mozilla.com/<wbr></wbr>addons/2011/04/19/add-on-<wbr></wbr>compatibility-rapid-releases/</a> </blockquote></div>
