Yesterday, at Day 2 of Google I/O, it was officially announced that <a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/#">Chromebooks</a> will be available in retail locations worldwide starting June 15th. &nbsp;Perhaps even more exciting news was the mention that for Educational institutions (and businesses) these would be available at $20/month/user ($28/mo/user for business) which could be a huge savings (70% over traditional PCs according to the graphic <a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/#business-education">here</a>). <br /><br />Here is the Keynote from Google I/O day two for those who missed it:<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MiYND_zvIc0" width="500"></iframe></div>
