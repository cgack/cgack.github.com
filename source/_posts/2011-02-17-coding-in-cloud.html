As a web developer I feel tethered to my desktop workstation, sure I can <a href="http://go-cloud-go.blogspot.com/2011/02/to-cloud.html">work remotely</a>,&nbsp;but how can I code in the cloud without the need for a desktop development environment. &nbsp;There are several cool tools for&nbsp;cloud-top&nbsp;development environments two of which I have been&nbsp;trialling recently.<br /><br /><a href="http://coderun.com/">CodeRun</a> is a development platform for three main types of applications, C#, JavaScript, and PHP. &nbsp;To get started all you need to do is go to the <a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">CodeRun IDE</a>&nbsp;select "New" and you can choose the project template of your choice and go. &nbsp;Most templates start with a clever label or button as a started, for example the jQuery UI project template starts with a "HelloWorld" dialog. <br /><br />One can also upload an existing project which I have stored elsewhere and get to work. &nbsp;This could be a great alternative to remotely connecting to an office based IDE and coding through that connection. &nbsp;With the CodeRun platform the user has access to debugging tools and an in browser secure "temporary sand-boxed environment" in which to run your projects.<br /><br />In my opinion a fantastic feature of this platform is the repository of <a href="http://coderun.com/code/">code samples</a>. &nbsp;CodeRun allows a user to share their code, assigning it a unique URL that the user may share. &nbsp;Just browsing through these projects would give a developer a great view of the power that this tool holds, or ideas for their own projects. &nbsp;I could see this as a great way for educators to get students to learn programming, without a need to buy/download/install massive amounts of expensive applications. &nbsp;A student could code their program and turn it in by sending their linked URL to their instructor for grading.<br /><br />So I think that CodeRun is a powerful application that is great for all levels of developers or even those with no experience coding who want to learn a new skill. &nbsp;Go for it. &nbsp;Happy Coding!</div>
