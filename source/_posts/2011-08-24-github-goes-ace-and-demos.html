A week ago <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace">announced</a> they were incorporating the Ace editor (which powers the <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>). &nbsp;Since I am a fan of both Cloud9 and GitHub, I gave it a whirl on my <a href="http://cgack.github.com/">GitHub Pages site</a>&nbsp;and was not disappointed. &nbsp;As advertised one can easily open a file for editing, preview the diff of your changes and commit. &nbsp;I think it will likely become useful to edit posts when (if) I finally decide to move my blog from here at Blogger to&nbsp;<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>&nbsp;(just because it looks fun). &nbsp;For me, this is particularly useful for simple changes like those I have made to my demos and experiments. &nbsp;Speaking of demos, I had created a simple drawing app using HTML5 canvas for my preschooler which evolved into a demo of the HTML5 History API thanks to a tweet by Christian Heilmann and subsequent read of his&nbsp;<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/making-history-with-the-august-dev-derby/">blog post</a>. &nbsp;I decided to use this History API to create the undo/redo functionality that I rely on heavily if i'm trying to draw something in a painting tool. &nbsp;As a bonus I added a localStorage call that will recreate your last drawing if your browser closes or you are forced to leave the site for a while. &nbsp;What does that look like:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1169831.js?file=gistfile1.js">
 </script><br />&nbsp;I entered the demo in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby">DevDerby</a>, you can find it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/html5-drawings">here</a>. &nbsp;I hope you&nbsp;'like' it too. &nbsp;(note: I've only really tested my demo on firefox 5, 6, 7, and 8 as well as chrome 13 &amp; 14, so your results may vary if you use a different browser)</div>
