Writing code in the browser with Chrome OS is an important item for me as a developer and there are a growing number of apps available to get your geek on in the cloud, but what else is awesome on Chrome OS?  Tons of things.  I have been <i>almost</i> exclusively utilizing my Cr-48 since early February at home, with the exception of my taxes (chrome beta/dev wasn't supported),  some photo management, the time when the developer build rendered the OS impossible to use (hooray for being a test pilot), and the occasional connection to my remote work computer.  So it is promising that I am able to find a replacement for everything I do on a computer in Chrome OS with limited exceptions.  What else?<br /><div><br /></div><div>I recently have been running some rigorous durability tests on my Cr-48, or I guess I should say Preschooler compatibility tests.  I realized this was needed when I arrived at my son's daycare to see a dozen preschoolers huddled around a computer clicking things and learning their letters, numbers, and sequences.  At home my son enjoys the stock windows Paint... a bunch.  What could I use on the Cr-48?  <a href="http://muro.deviantart.com/">deviantArt muro</a> is a cool choice although it took us a bit to get used to the track pad.  Of course the Chrome web store has many options like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcbkbpnkkkipelfledbfocopglifcfmi">Poppit</a>, a balloon popping game which really tests the durability of the track pad.  But one of my favorite apps is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jhfhmaajajcjoijfaceafiembkmhcddc">MeeGenius! Children's Books</a>, which reads classic children's books out loud and highlights the words as it reads.  Our favorite kid friendly site is and has been the <a href="http://pbskids.org/">PBS kids site</a> which as an avid PBS kids family is full of friendly educational games from our most familiar characters. <br /><br />For me, I have recently been utilizing my Cr-48 to read books on <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>.  It may not read super easy in direct sunlight, but I can read at night without a light.  There are tons of books, "over 3 million", which is enough to keep any reader busy for a while.  So there is plenty for everyone on Chrome OS, especially for everyday computer needs.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-4704811775203935933?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
