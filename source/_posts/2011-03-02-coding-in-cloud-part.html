"your Cloud9 beta account has been activated". &nbsp;I had been anxiously awaiting this email (although one can sign up now without a wait period) to continue my quest to find the best coding environment for use with my Chrome OS on my Cr-48. &nbsp;<a href="http://cloud9ide.com/">Cloud9</a> is another development-as-a-service platform that claims to be the go to solution to marry HTML5/JavaScript development with <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> and has received some decent <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2381167,00.asp">reviews</a> lately after &nbsp;its presentation at DEMO Spring 2011. &nbsp;So I had to login and get coding.<br /><br />I followed the link provided and once signed in I was able to quickly create a new project. &nbsp;I added an html file and a&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;file to create a simple "hello world" website to test how the cloud9 development environment worked. &nbsp;I saved my work, then clicked "Preview" and my boring website was previewed in a new tab. &nbsp;Everything was working well until I returned to my project files and decided I wanted to rename them from untitled.html and untitled.js to test.html and test.js. &nbsp;Moments later as I was about the check out the "Run" and "Debug" options mysteriously the screen flashed and the files were once again named as the default "untitled". &nbsp;I saved the project to return later and investigate.<br /><br />So I signed back in to my account and saw my previously saved project and selected "Open". &nbsp;This took me to the sign in screen only the styles were all gone and it was a bunch of blank screen with the login box. &nbsp;I of course had to try again, and after repeating this behavior a few times I thought, "maybe this is because its a beta account". &nbsp;So I created a new account and thought "at least I can get a test project started to my testing so I can do a good comparison of cloud9 with kodingen and coderun" but I was not able to create a project at all. &nbsp;I tried to use the shared github project that cloud9 provides as an example and that to failed. <br /><br />Apparently cloud9 is getting hit hard with tons of new users who are experience some issues similar to mine, at least according to some of their <a href="http://twitter.com/cloud9ide/">twitter posts</a>. &nbsp;I'll be anxious to get a real review of this cloud based development environment because in my brief time on the inside, it seemed very easy to use and elegantly constructed.</div>
