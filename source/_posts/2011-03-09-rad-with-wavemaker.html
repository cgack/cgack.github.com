Yesterday <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/03/08/vmware-acquires-wavemaker/">announced</a> they had acquired <a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/">WaveMaker</a>. &nbsp;I had not explored WaveMaker, but luckily the news exposed this wonderful development tool for me. &nbsp;WaveMaker is a tool for Rapid Application Development (RAD) that is perhaps the worlds greatest WYSIWYG editor. &nbsp;Not just WYSIWYG for HTML or page layout, but it can completely eliminate the need for Java coding and with its integrated data structure mappings with <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>&nbsp;it can&nbsp;easily integrate with any enterprise database. &nbsp;The point is that anyone who is computer capable can write a fully functional web application and maintain it without the need for developer time. &nbsp;As a bonus, there is integration with the big names in cloud hosting like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>, Eucalyptus, and OpSource<div><br /></div><div>I checked out the example videos and was amazed. &nbsp;I was especially excited because I of course noted there was a <a href="http://cloud.wavemaker.com/">cloud version</a> available. &nbsp; Of course the site is down for&nbsp;maintenance without any idea as to when service would be restored. &nbsp;Being an avid user or Chrome OS on my Cr-48 I was extremely bummed. &nbsp;So I decided to &nbsp;cheat a little (its still browser based app development, however it required installing software) and I cranked up developer mode on my Cr-48 and entered my Ubuntu Linux boot. &nbsp;I downloaded WaveMaker and kicked it off. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Amazing. &nbsp;I created a test project with one of the provided templates and started dragging objects onto my web page. &nbsp;Styling is available at the click of a button, and wiring up events to buttons exposes so special handling can be added. &nbsp;I can already grasp the power of this tool and I have not spent a whole hour in it. &nbsp;I can imagine in the coming days and weeks as I get the chance to get more familiar with it, I will be even more amazed. &nbsp;I am also excited for when the cloud.wavemaker.com site is operational again when the true power of being able to code an application in the cloud and even deploy to a cloud host like EC2 without leaving the comfort of the browser.</div></div>
