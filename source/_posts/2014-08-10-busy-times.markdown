I have had a busy time over that last few months. Firstly, I have been engaged in a very ambitious and exciting project for my day job.

Aside from this keeping me busy, I also had a talk accepted for the jQuery Conference in Portland in June. This was my first talk at a big technology conference but I think it went well and I hope to do it again.

If you listened to at least the beginning of that talk, you may have heard me mention that I’ve been writing a book. This book has been a great deal of fun, but has also been challenging. Between research, writing code, writing text, editing, and following up with the technical reviewer it has kept me busy. It should be published this fall so stay tuned…
